# 🧠 GenAI Projects Collection

Welcome to my repository of Generative AI projects!  
This repo serves as a central hub for all the GenAI experiments, prototypes, and applications I build — ranging from LLM apps and agents to multimodal AI and local RAG systems.

## 📂 Project List

Each subfolder contains a standalone GenAI project with its own README and dependencies:
- `chatbot-langchain-openai`: A simple chatbot using LangChain + OpenAI + Streamlit
- `local-rag-ollama`: Fully offline RAG pipeline using Ollama, ChromaDB, and Redis
- `cloud-ai-agent`: Business AI assistant powered by Amazon Bedrock and Manus AI
- `github-repo-analyzer`: An LLM tool that analyzes GitHub repos and generates insights
- More coming soon...

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- 🔁 LangChain, LlamaIndex
- 🤖 OpenAI, Ollama, HuggingFace, Bedrock
- 💡 Streamlit, FastAPI, Next.js
- 📚 ChromaDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
- 🛠️ Python, JavaScript, Shell

## 🚀 Getting Started
Each project has a `README.md` with steps to set up and run. Most use virtual environments and `.env` files for API keys.

## 📬 Feedback & Collaboration
